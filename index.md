## Welcome!

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Statistical Science department at Duke University, working with Dr. [Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io) and Dr. [Alexander A. Fisher](https://athos00.github.io). Broadly, I am interested in developing likelihood-based methodologies for stochastic models. Currently, my research lies in the intersection of **Epidemiology and Phylodynamic Inference**. I am working on the problem of missing data in epidemiology and am trying to determine how to improve the inference of epidemic parameters when we also have sequence data alongside case-count data.

I grew up in Kolkata, India, where I also completed my undergraduate and master's degrees. During my Master’s studies, I had the privilege of working with Dr. [Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io), an experience that profoundly shaped my research interests and perspective. At that time, I explored estimating the spectral gap of the Polya-Gamma Sampler and the importance sampling estimator.
