## Welcome!

I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at Duke University. I have the privilege to work under the guidance of Dr. [Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io) and Dr. [Alexander A. Fisher](https://athos00.github.io). Currently, my research lies at the intersection of **epidemiology and phylodynamic inference**. Stochastic epidemic models evolve in continuous time, while available data are typically reported in aggregated daily or weekly counts. Part of my work involves developing computationally efficient and flexible approaches to address this fundamental missing-data challenge. In addition, I am exploring how incorporating sequence data alongside case-count data can improve inference of key epidemic parameters and provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease dynamics.

I grew up in Kolkata, India, and completed my undergraduate and master's degrees there. During my Master’s studies, I was fortunate to work with Dr. [Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io), an experience that profoundly shaped my research interests and perspective. Under her mentorship, I explored theoretical and computational questions in Markov chain Monte Carlo, including estimating the spectral gap of the Polya–Gamma sampler and developing importance sampling estimators for the Metropolis-within-Gibbs chain.
